"""
    Purpose:
    - This is a prototype testing the downloading and
    modification of files using an open source API.
    - Goal is to assist in the prototyping of the CMHC database made by Kevin Chen
    - The goal is to effectively retrieve information from several external sources
    and then to integrate them into a single database presented in CSV format
    - The resulting data should be able to be easily imported and edited manually
    and the application will not overwrite the data manually added by the user
